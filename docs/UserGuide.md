SportSync is a **desktop app for managing training sessions and athletes, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SportSync can get your training management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `sportsync.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/SportSync/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SportSync.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar sportsync.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   e.g. `cd Desktop\New_Folder` and then `java -jar sportsync.jar`<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all athletes.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 a/311, Clementi Ave 2, r/35 t/friends t/owesMoney` : Adds athlete `John Doe` to SportSync.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd athlete shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all athletes.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Features**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the coach.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
