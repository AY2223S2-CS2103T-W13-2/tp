## **Project: SportSync**

SportSync is a desktop address book application used for coaching student athletes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
* ### Session function [\#29](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/76)

Added the ability to sort the contact list.

* **What it does:** Allows the creation and deletion of session object and enable scheduling of session with athletes.
* **Justification:** This feature provides scheduling, a primary function of SportsSync for coaches to arrange session with their athletes.
* **Highlights:** Implementing this feature involved understanding general architecture and relationship between all classes.

### Mark/Unmark function [\#50](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/50)

Added the ability to undo and redo previously entered commands.

* **What it does:** Allows each student in the addressbook to be mark and unmarked.
* **Justification:** This feature enables users to calculate their earnings more accurately since athletes only pay for training if they attend.
* **Highlights:** Implementing this feature required understanding the right data structures to use, e.g. a HashMap to store the attendance field.


### Add tag/Remove tag function [\#50](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/pull/87)

Added the ability to undo and redo previously entered commands.

* **What it does:** Allows users to add and remove tags, creating a grouping functionality in a sense.
* **Justification:** This feature provides greater convenience to users who would simply like to add and remove a single tag. 
* **Highlights:** Implementing this feature involved a good understanding of the already implemented edit-command.
