### Project: SportSync

SportSync is a desktop address book application used for coaching student athletes. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view payment rate of each student.
  * What it does: Each student now has a payment rate attribute.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience of the user as the payment rate of each student can be easily viewed.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of the dependencies. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
